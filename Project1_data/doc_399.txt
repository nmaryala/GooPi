Boone Pickens, a legendary American oil tycoon. https://cnb.cx/2UNj2eZ pic.twitter.com/ElqBS2giTV I am saddened to learn about the death of a Dallas icon, T. Boone Pickens. While he might have been an Oklahoma boy, he’ll always be remembered as a Texas legend. I’m incredibly grateful for his many contributions to Dallas. My thoughts and prayers are with his family & friends. This is a card I received from Pickens when I graduated high school and was planning on making my way to Stillwater to be a Cowboy just like he was. #GoPokespic.twitter.com/lnHo3ILQKN One of my all time favorite memories was being able to watch a game with @boonepickens junior year. Oklahoma State University would not be the place it is without you, Boone Pickens. Rest In Peace to a true legend. #RIPBoonepic.twitter.com/ewhy8ZKMNI You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

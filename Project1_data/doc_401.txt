I remember interning at WFMU when those first Stress cassettes came in, writing for more, connecting to songs like Walking The Cow, then making my own tapes. So much beauty from darkness, so much song-friend-ness. Daniel Johnston was the most naturally gifted songwriter in American music history. I will not hear otherwise. RIP The first time I saw Daniel Johnston perform, I cried twice. I’d just never in my life seen such an honest performance. We keep the signed print of one of his paintings that I bought that night on our mantle. RIP to a brilliant artist.

Photo by George The key goal of The Commons is to share hidden treasures from the world's public photography archives. Please help make the photographs you enjoy more discoverable by adding tags and leaving comments. Your contributions and knowledge make these photos even richer* Participating Institutions FAQ Rights Statement A random sprinkling of our participating institutions... 08 08 13_4089_edited-1 from Kalamazoo Public Library 09 17 13_5351_edited-1 from Kalamazoo Public Library 08 01 13_3720_edited-1 from Kalamazoo Public Library 09 17 13_5438_edited-1 from Kalamazoo Public Library 09 17 13_5407_edited-1 from Kalamazoo Public Library 08 01 13_3682_edited-1 from Kalamazoo Public Library Carter Buton Album Loan_00094 from San Diego Air & Space Museum Archives 09 17 13_5391_edited-1 from Kalamazoo Public Library 08 08 13_4081_edited-1 from Kalamazoo Public Library A new way to share photos on Flickr The Commons was launched on January 16 2008, when we released our pilot project in partnership with The Library of Congress. Both Flickr and the Library were overwhelmed by the positive response to the project! Thank you! The program has two main objectives: Please let us know you're interested by registering here. It helps a lot if you let us know some background about your institution, and direct us to any online photo collections you already have. We've already seen fantastic contribution from the Flickr membership. Your tags and conversations about the content in The Commons has been wonderful! The best way to get involved is to add a tag or two to the photos you see, and if you happen to know anything else about the subject, by all means add a comment. This new rights statement is being contained to the institutions participating in The Commons, at the account level. It is a requirement for participation in the program that institutions may rightly claim "no known copyright restrictions" on the content they share. More information. *Any Flickr member is able to add tags or comment on these collections. If you're a dork about it, shame on you. This is for the good of humanity, dude!!

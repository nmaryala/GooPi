Some smartly advised him, taking-on these dictators was good politics in S. FL. Don’t tell his Florida enablers. Truth is, Trump manipulated the exiles in my community. @marcorubio, I’m talking to you.https://twitter.com/newsbysmiley/status/1171837720450277376 … Ana Navarro-Cárdenas added, Ana Navarro-Cárdenas Retweeted Yahoo News Now do assault weapons.

Trump Can you act like a normal President -like a decent human- at least on this one day a year? One day. #NeverForgethttps://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1171760235935125508 … Ana Navarro-Cárdenas added, Ana Navarro-Cárdenas Retweeted Marco Rubio Trump has no moral compass on foreign policy. He cozied-up to practically every other murderous dictator, except in Cuba, Nicaragua, Venezuela for a reason: Florida politics. Truth is, Bolton (+others) thought removing Maduro would be easier. Trump’s pal, Putin, had other ideas.https://twitter.com/marcorubio/status/1171742438370754561 … Ana Navarro-Cárdenas added, Ana Navarro-Cárdenas Retweeted Go back to Russian Troll School and learn the difference between “your” and “you’re”. https://twitter.com/siliconvalleyr3/status/1171531201330302979 … Ana Navarro-Cárdenas added, Trump has now gone through more National Security Advisors than wives. That’s not a low bar. Pot calling the kettle orange. Trump who boasted of grabbing “pussy”, calls black athletes, “sons of bitches”, calls countries, “shitholes”....has the chutzpah to call @chrissyteigen, “filthy-mouth”. And then, the guy who paid hush-money to his lover attacks Sanford’s affair. Ana Navarro-Cárdenas Retweeted Joe Biden Years ago, gun issue wasn’t a priority for me. Then, my cousin’s son got killed at #Pulse. My friend’s nephew got killed in Vegas. 17 more ppl got killed at #Parkland, 40 mins from my home. It could happen to any of us, any time, anywhere. It’s an American crisis. We need action.https://twitter.com/joebiden/status/1170747878085681152 … Ana Navarro-Cárdenas added, Ana Navarro-Cárdenas Retweeted Natasha Bertrand Pence at out-of-way Trump Hotel in Ireland. Trump suggesting Trump Doral for G-7. 100% rate hike at Mar-a-Lago. Selling access thru hotel in DC. 25% of his presidency (at cost of +$100MM to taxpayers), at his properties. Corruption. Violations of Emoluments Clause. Trump Swamp.https://twitter.com/natashabertrand/status/1170875768056012806 … Ana Navarro-Cárdenas added, Spent bulk of day not watching any news or even going online. After reading @yashar’s tweets raving about it, I binge-watched @Yellowstone. It’s so, so good! One of the best lazy Sundays since 2016 election. Every now & then, it’s good to tune out & recharge batteries. Try it. I thought the cowardice, complicity, hypocrisy of elected Republicans could no longer amaze me. I was wrong. Imagine GOP reaction if Obama had announced by tweet that he’d planned a secret meeting with Taliban at Camp David on same week as 9/11 Anniversary. The freaking Taliban! Ana Navarro-Cárdenas Retweeted The Daily Beast But I thought “Dynasties” were bad for America.

Is #PresidentLoco still tweeting about Alabama? Ana Navarro-Cárdenas Retweeted Donald J. Trump Dear God. This man’s narcissism knows no bounds. Right now, Americans in the Carolinas are dealing with the effects of Dorian. The Bahamas is devastated and littered with corpses. And this is what this heartless, lame excuse for a human is obsessively focused on. #PresidentLocohttps://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1170089069105340416 … Ana Navarro-Cárdenas added, We just came back from a photo safari in Africa. Rhinos are magnificent creatures. We should be doing everything we can, to protect them. This is reason 2,343 to loathe Trump. https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1170081761272971266 …pic.twitter.com/eSqFXfquyp Ana Navarro-Cárdenas Retweeted Vivian Salama Who?https://twitter.com/vmsalama/status/1169922205775478786 … Ana Navarro-Cárdenas added, @ananavarro hasn't Tweeted yet.

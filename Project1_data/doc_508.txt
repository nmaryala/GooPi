Yes California's Senate passed a bill that could force Uber and other gig economy giants to reclassify their workers as employees. Under the new law, workers are only contractors if the work they’re doing is outside the usual course of a company’s businesshttps://bloom.bg/34GgrrE Uber won’t comply with a new California law requiring contract workers to be reclassified as employees, saying drivers are not core to its businesshttps://nyti.ms/2ULFLrW This is completely wrong. @Uber will absolutely comply with the law—but the law does not “require contract workers to be reclassified as employees.” I made that clear on a call today with your reporters. Here’s what I said, and we’ll be also posting a full transcript so folks can see for themselves.http://t.uber.com/ab5 NEWS: Uber says it will not reclassify drivers as employees in the wake of landmark California law, despite the lack of ride-hail exemption in #AB5. Lead attorney argues Uber is exempt from requirements because "drivers’ work is outside the usual course of Uber's business." Sorry, @faizsays, but I’m afraid you got it completely wrong; I never said anything remotely like that, and thankfully we‘ll post a transcript so folks can see for themselves. What I did say was that we’re optimistic we can win under the ABC test bc we’ve won under the hardest prong of that test before. Uber is not exempt from AB5 and I’d never suggest we were. This is excellent news for Uber and Lyft drivers—and for every employee who has been misclassified as an "independent contractor" by their employer. Now let's keep up the fight for full employee status for workers across the country.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/technology/california-gig-economy-bill.html … this is for transpo wonks https://www.uber.com/newsroom/ab5-update/ …pic.twitter.com/s2iraH66Ui i love this company https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/economy/uber-california-bill.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share …pic.twitter.com/JPmHCn4CTr If the drivers aren’t a core part of Uber’s business, then I guess the company wouldn’t mind if they went on strike https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/business/economy/uber-california-bill.html …pic.twitter.com/w5zyX2EUVu Uber's Chief Legal Officer, Tony West, says their drivers are not a "core" part of their business.pic.twitter.com/SwoJRn6YjI Nathan Bernhardt Retweeted The New York Times This is going to be Uber in Australia all over again; the company becomes a rogue actor decreeing it can violate any law it pleases at its own discretion, solely b/c no one has the wherewithal to kick down the door to one of their fancy parties and take away the c-suite in cuffshttps://twitter.com/nytimes/status/1171887421174235136 … Nathan Bernhardt added, they will not stop operating or indeed change their business practices at all, simply move their servers and offices outside of CA jurisdiction (to the extent they're even still there) and then dare the cops to arrest the Uber drivers California lawmakers have passed a bill that could affect the future of American work by giving wage and benefit protections to contract workers at Uber and other companies.http://apne.ws/FIQ8Vwj You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

For information, see the following web pages: UNIVERSITY REQUIREMENTS - Credits Minimum 120 credits must be obtained, 45 of which must be earned in residence. Residence credits are defined as credits earned for work done while registered at the UMass Amherst campus or while enrolled in one of the University's formal exchange programs. Minimum Overall Grade Point Average (GPA) - 2.00 minimum cumulative GPA is required. Minimum Stockbridge School of Agriculture Cumulative Grade Point Average (GPA) - 2.00 minimum cumulative GPA is required for courses within the Stockbridge School of Agriculture majors. Independent Study - students wishing to complete a research project or independent learning project must select a faculty member within the major who will approve the project and provide guidance. An Independent Study form must be completed, which specifies the number of credits to be earned, a statement of objectives, planned activities, and criteria to be used for evaluation and grading. This form must be filed with the School's Undergraduate Affairs Office before the project is initiated. Internships/Practicums - an internship is a summer or semester-long work experience that allows students to "apprentice" with professionals in their field. Internships are intended to be learning experiences, and do not necessarily provide significant monetary compensation. Instead, academic credits are earned. Students can earn 12 credits for a full time, semester long internship experience and 3 to 9 credits for a summer program. Prior to undertaking an internship, the student and his/her faculty sponsor must complete an Academic Contract (Independent Study/Practicum form), including planned activities, a statement of objectives, as well as criteria for evaluation and grading.

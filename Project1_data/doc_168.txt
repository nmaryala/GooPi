General Education classes, one credit Stockbridge classes, transfer courses, independent study and practicum classes may be used to fulfill this requirement. A total of 20 credits of approved courses are required with at least one course from each category below: 1. Biophysical Systems 2. Economic Systems 3. Social Systems This category ensures that all three aspects of sustainability (environmental, economic and equity) are included in the course of study. The following programs offer courses that may fulfil these categories: • Accounting • Finance • Public Health • Animal Sciences • Geology • Regional Planning • Biology • Legal Studies • Resource Economics • Building/Const. Tech • Management • Sustainable Communities • Economics • Marketing • Women, Gender and Sexuality Studies • Education • Nutrition Students are encouraged to take up to the maximum of 18 credits as Internships or Practicum which may be counted toward Professional Electives. These may be farm internships, working with non-profits or businesses, or study abroad. Stockbridge is committed to helping students gain practical experience as part of their major area of study. By combining your classroom education with experience in the field, your practicum/internship should be a highlight of your Stockbridge education. Every internship is different and one size does not fit all! The requirements have flexibility. If you are working to establish your own farm and your life situation is such that you are not able to complete an independent study away from home, we can find a “residential solution.” For more information, talk with our SFF Internship Coordinator, Renee Ciulla at rciulla@umass.edu.

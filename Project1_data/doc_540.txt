Ya Thousands of women undergo a routine gyno procedure known as LEEP every year without being informed of a potentially devastating result: the loss of their ability to enjoy sex. Cosmo investigates why doctors aren’t taking this side effect more seriously.https://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/a28798959/leep-side-effects-risks-sexual-pleasure-loss/ … LEEPs are super common, popular, and fast: a doctor slices into the cervix and scoops out sketchy tissue, the same way you might cut a bruise out of an apple. And it usually works, reducing a person's cancer risk back down to zero.pic.twitter.com/bKVEJuXc2a And the side effects are seemingly straightforward: bleeding, discharge, and the increased risk of pregnancy complications. However, hundreds of women insist that LEEP also triggered a loss of sensation in the vagina, increased pain during sex, and the inability to orgasm. But meanwhile, gynecologists aren’t convinced that LEEP is causing these issues. http://csmo.us/z4tXZYF pic.twitter.com/s1esaf5Nfo Dr. Irwin Goldstein, the director of @SDSexualMed, believes these women. He cites a 2004 study led by a @Rutgers neuroscientist, which theorized that some LEEPs cut too deeply into the cervix & vital nerve endings, silencing the genital connection to the brain.pic.twitter.com/4RvAy93JI9 OB-GYNs don’t agree with Dr. Goldstein and consider his theories “controversial,” even though hundreds of women have come forward complaining of the same issues.pic.twitter.com/ro9FahZcwL Writer @hannahsmothers_ spoke with a handful of these silenced women. Visit the link to read their stories:http://csmo.us/aTIPVgD i spent ~year reporting this, and in that time, no two doctors gave me the same answer when i asked about the potential for sexual side effects from LEEP. many were generally thrown off by the premise of that question.https://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/a28798959/leep-side-effects-risks-sexual-pleasure-loss/ … .@hannahsmothers_'s last big piece for @Cosmopolitan is a heartbreaker. Her work is so important and necessary and I'm so excited to continue reading her at Vice.https://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/a28798959/leep-side-effects-risks-sexual-pleasure-loss/ … this is a fantastic feature by @Cosmopolitan on a very common gynecological procedure with potentially devastating risks few women even know about.https://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/a28798959/leep-side-effects-risks-sexual-pleasure-loss/ … Reminder: women aren’t the only potential victims here but also WHAT THE FUCKhttps://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/a28798959/leep-side-effects-risks-sexual-pleasure-loss/ … Robin Marty me-Retweet Jessica Goodman wow this piecehttps://twitter.com/jessgood/status/1171484790186397696 … Robin Marty menambahkan, this is chilling, and a must-read. more evidence that research into women's health is severely lacking.https://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/a28798959/leep-side-effects-risks-sexual-pleasure-loss/ … Callie Ahlgrim me-Retweet hannah this is a brilliantly reported piece. not only tells a compelling human story but also explores a much broader cultural issue: female-specific medical issues, as a general rule, are so viciously underresearched that it makes my gd blood boil!!!!!!!!!!!https://twitter.com/hannahsmothers_/status/1171504437010956288 … Callie Ahlgrim menambahkan, Miatta Lebile me-Retweet hannah Ladies read! I've had irregular cervical cells and luckily didn't have LEEP but I dont want anyone to go into it without knowing what can happen if you do. It saves lives but also being able to talk to your doctor about outcomes of the procedure is important!!!https://twitter.com/hannahsmothers_/status/1171504426734931968 … Miatta Lebile menambahkan, ok but why ? me-Retweet hannah I almost had this procedure last month and no one at any point ever warned me this was even in the realm of possible risks... but we spent 10 minutes talking about how it might affect hypothetical future pregnancies I don’t even want. I’m so angry???https://twitter.com/hannahsmothers_/status/1171504426734931968 … ok but why ? menambahkan, Not being believed when experiencing complications from poorly-studied gynecological procedures (in my case: 3 failed IUDs) is an experience I know all too well. People w vulvas deserve better researchhttps://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/a28798959/leep-side-effects-risks-sexual-pleasure-loss/ … hannah me-Retweet Cosmopolitan My last story for Cosmo is up today (and in print if that’s your thing) and it is, appropriately, about something gynecologists should know about but don’thttps://twitter.com/cosmopolitan/status/1171419938654949379 … hannah menambahkan, something i love about @mckinneykelsey's reporting is she always finds overlooked but obvious details that i never would've considered, like this bit about trying to fit shoulder pads made for boys on a teen girl body https://deadspin.com/this-football-league-was-built-for-girls-who-love-to-hi-1835580300 …pic.twitter.com/VTeB6Nq80u I've been pitching this story for years. Happy people are finally listening @Cosmopolitanhttps://www.cosmopolitan.com/health-fitness/a28798959/leep-side-effects-risks-sexual-pleasure-loss/?fbclid=IwAR1yG8ory0mHVUnSNRHZ5konrVBqrq7hia3Tz5clMvNHZNQVa3XRwTtX8R8 … "doctors love LEEP because it’s so easy to perform. It’s also considered safe, with seemingly straightforward side effects" except what if it also causes pain with sex and loss of sensation/orgasm? #overtesting #overtreatment #reproductivejusticehttps://tinyurl.com/yykbnh3q Well, it kinda sucks to see some of the responses from the nurse practitioners I asked about @hannahsmothers_ article in @Cosmopolitan re: sexual dysfunction after a LEEP. One of the first comments? "And the rates of sexual dysfunction in cancer treatment are..." #nursetwitter WE KNOW. This is the same dismissive rhetoric patients are already getting. Also, HELLO, one of the people interviewed literally said she was only able to move on with her life when she finally (after dozens of docs) felt HEARD & BELIEVED by a clinician. #nursetwitter #medtwitter ANYWAY a couple ppl have disclosed personal total hysterectomies (with removal of the cervix) with no reported change in sexual function/orgasm.

We need to decriminalize marijuana and erase past convictions. Sign up now if you’re with me. Nigeria needs infrastructure, social welfare, and human capital development to grow. Low tax revenue is hampering its ability to invest in those areas. @AmakaAnku walks through the vicious cycle with @AlakeTope and @osaeB.https://bloom.bg/2ZA76Ca 10 of 11 Nigerian eurobonds are trading at higher prices/lower yields than when they were issued. A reminder that #Nigeria remains quite attractive to FPI. Nigerian govts have historically prioritized debt repayment (even if to the detriment of other priorities); market sees thatpic.twitter.com/S6ZO0aqNEv But, is it legal? You can’t just snatch ppl’s deposits when they default on a loan. Devil would be in the details, I suppose. Makes sense to curtail deliberate default by elites who just feel they can get away with it. But how much of current NPLs fall in this category?

Amaka Anku Retweeted Dr Ola Brown (Orekunrin) We often forget that Brazil (+ Mexico&Argentina) is really a contemporary of US & Canada (modern Brazil was founded in 1822 vs US in 1776). They fell behind in part due to the faulty Bretton Wood consensus and a failure to focus on welfare following progressive revolution in US.https://twitter.com/NaijaFlyingDr/status/1102178303119634435 … Amaka Anku added, @AmakaAnku hasn't Tweeted yet.

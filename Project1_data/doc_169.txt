Jump to navigation The Stockbridge School of Agriculture and the College of Natural Sciences offer a variety of scholarships and awards to recognize the hard work and academic success of our students, assist students with the expense of their education, and support student research and internships. The majority of these scholarships and awards are funded through the generosity of alumni and other members of the CNS community. We encourage all current Stockbridge students to apply. The university has implemented AcademicWorks, an online application system for scholarships offered at UMass Amherst. Simply enroll in AcademicWorks, fill out both the UMass general application and the CNS application. The system will automatically submit your application to the scholarships and awards for which you are fully eligible and will inform you of other scholarships for which you would need to supply additional materials to apply. Go to the AcademicWorks webpage and sign in with your UMass Net ID and password. • Complete both the general application and the CNS application. The system will show if you are eligible for scholarships that require additional application materials. • Click on each scholarship link and upload any required supplementary materials (such as resumes or faculty recommendations). • Submit your application and check your dashboard to see the status of any pending and submitted applications. Email acadworks@umass.edu if you have any questions. NEW ENGLAND SPORTS TURF "Charles K.

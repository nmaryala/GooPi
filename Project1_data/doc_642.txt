For the first time, @NASAHubble has found water vapor in the atmosphere of a habitable-zone exoplanet. More: https://go.nasa.gov/30b4mr4 pic.twitter.com/0ANtGxbnPx Using #Hubble data, @UCL astronomers detected water vapour in the atmosphere of K2-18b, making it the only #exoplanet known to have both water & temperatures that could support life.

It is located around 110 light years away.https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02721-2 … ? ??????? Becky Smethurst ????? Retweet Josh Lothringer I cannot stress how incredible this is. They detected the tiniest bit of starlight that came from the star and then passed through the planet’s atmosphere on its way to us; then managed to detect the tiny bit in the light that was absorbed by the water in that atmosphere#k218bhttps://twitter.com/jdlothringer/status/1171600474224713729 … ? ??????? Becky Smethurst ????????, K2 18b may be the first exoplanet found to support liquid water, thought to be an essential ingredient for life.https://www.sciencenews.org/article/first-known-exoplanet-rain-clouds-water-droplets … what you have here are two papers looking at largely the same set of data (though with some significant variability), and coming up with two very different ideas for what the K2-18b exoplanet and its water content look like https://www.technologyreview.com/s/614298/water-vapor-has-been-spotted-on-a-habitable-zone-planet-110-light-years-away/ … "super-Earth" vs "mini-Neptune" There are a lot of misleading stories about this out there. > Does K2-18b have liquid water? Not clear yet, but probably not. >Can it support life? Almost certainly not. >Is it a Super-Earth? According to the UCL team, yes. According to most other astronomers, no. Not true, water vapor has been detected in that atmosphere of nearly 30 #exoplanets thus far. This is the first time it has been seen in the atmosphere (not on) of a cool temperate exoplanet. ? ??????? Loren Grush ????? Retweet The Verge To be clear, there's really no chance that this place is habitable, at least for life as we know it here on Earth. Still a significant finding, but this place doesn't have a rocky surfacehttps://twitter.com/verge/status/1171777937122713601 … ? ??????? Loren Grush ????????, ? ??????? Erin M. May, PhD ????? Retweet NASA This is a Mini-Neptune and *not* habitable. The pressure at any surface of this planet is likey *10 times higher* than the deepest point of the ocean in Earth Astronomers - we need to do better in communicating these types of results with the public #scicommhttps://twitter.com/NASA/status/1171834238435508225 … ? ??????? Erin M. May, PhD ????????, can you tell I'm frustrated with the presentation of the water vapor detected *in the atmosphere* of K2-18 b result? This is an awesome result! Ice giants (mini-giants? idk) are super cool and this is a new class of one. It's a tiny Neptune-like world. This is neat by itself! but its atmosphere is still mainly hydrogen. 300x metallicity (as the paper(s) say) is about 25% water. And the rest is a mix of mostly hydrogen and helium based on the size of the feature! #UPDATE Eight times the mass of Earth and twice as big, K2-18b orbits in its star's "habitable zone" at a distance -- neither too far nor too close -- where water can exist in liquid form, scientists reportedhttp://u.afp.com/JLck ???????? ?? ?????????? ??????????? ??? ??? ????????? ??? ???

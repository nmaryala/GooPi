We offer workshops focused on professional skills, personal growth and interpersonal communication designed to help you, as a self-identified woman or non-binary person of color, develop your leadership capacities and confidence. Applications are open now at http://bit.ly/2FjJ05W [3] and will remain open until all spaces are filled. P.R.O.P.S: Presenting Real, Original, Powerful Stories offers students the opportunity to share inspiring stories & innovative discoveries. Selected students will present a 5-12 minute-talk in a live showcase which will be recorded and made available to larger audiences. Talks can explore a range of topics addressing personal growth, academic research, or new perspectives. This can result in shared learning, inspiration, and motivation to make a positive change. Participating students will attend workshops and receive support to prepare them for the showcase. Come to our office at 127, New Africa House, on the first Wednesday of the month, 5:30-7 PM for an informal gathering to discuss issues that are important to our community over some snacks and refreshments. Be on the lookout for additional panel discussions and workshops on topics relevant to our students and community! Some examples of past events include a panel by local female entrepreneurs of color, discussions on women in media and workshops on leadership and drumming. Spoken Word Night offers an opportunity to perform original spoken word pieces and/or poetry, as well as the work of favorite artists/authors in relation to power, liberation, oppression, cultural and social identities, resistance, solidarity, and other social justice related topics. All are welcome to be part of this creative, diverse, vibrant, and supportive environment. Take a break, sit back, and relax to a great film, taking the opportunity to connect with your community. WOCLN hosts screenings of thought-provoking films, followed by an open, community-based discussion. We provide the film, the popcorn, and beverages. You can bring your friends, classmates and roommates. All are welcome!

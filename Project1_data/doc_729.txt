Eduroam is the secure wireless access for the UMass campus.It is an encrypted, world-wide roaming access service developed for the international research and education community. In order to connect to Eduroam, you will need to download and install software called XpressConnect on your self-managed computer or device. You will only have to set this up once, and you will automatically connect to wireless when you are on campus. Other campuses are also using Eduroam, so you might be able to connect to their wireless networks when you are visiting other schools. Once the software has been installed, you will be prompted for your username. For the username, use NetID@umass.edu. For instance: jsmith@umass.edu Do not run the XpressConnect software on your managed Isenberg computer. If you have problems logging into Eduroam, try adding @umass.edu to your NetID. If that doesn't work, contact TSS. Contact Lynda Vassallo in Room 228. Please return your old ink cartridge for recycling. Contact Lynda Vassallo in Room 228.

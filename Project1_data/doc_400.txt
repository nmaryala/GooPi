I now try to focus on individual stories from that day to help remind me of the emotions I felt. This year I want to focus on the dogs of 9/11pic.twitter.com/8vFeAcntcp Roughly 300 Search and Rescue dogs were deployed to ground zero. Only 100 were equipped to handle what they encountered. Most SAR dogs weren’t trained to handle large scale operations or urban environments. 9/11 rewrote the training guide for SAR dogs The most famous dog from that day was Bretagne. She was the last known SAR dog that was at ground zero. She also worked rescue missions at Katrina and Ivan. One of her greatest contributions was acting as a spokesperson for the dogs of 9/11. She died on June 7, 2016pic.twitter.com/xNBH1fq555 Riley is the subject of the most famous K9 photo from 9/11. Riley was trained to find living people and was not trained to be a cadaver dog.

I will be back for you.” His handler locked him in his kennel before helping victims.pic.twitter.com/9JeuAh8xy2 Worf found the remains of two firefighters on his first day. He was immediately retired because he emotionally shutdown and quit eating. "He kind of withdrew from everything. There was so much death there, it was emotional for the dogs." - Mike Owens his handlerpic.twitter.com/xqQvQyrDK3 Ricky was the smallest SAR dog at ground zero. This was crucial for search operations as he could reach spots other dogs couldn’t. He would frequently go places his handler couldn’t see.

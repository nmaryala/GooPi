Find out what we saw this year on the ringed planet: https://go.nasa.gov/2NUC0it pic.twitter.com/MH7JrsXibJ For the first time, researchers using Hubble have detected water vapor signatures in the atmosphere of a planet beyond our solar system that resides in the "habitable zone." For more information: https://go.nasa.gov/2LplGVb pic.twitter.com/ey3uz2ynMk #HubbleClassic #OTD in 2013, Hubble captured this picture of a strange asteroid called P/2013 P5, discovering that it had six comet-like tails: https://go.nasa.gov/2LpnM7K pic.twitter.com/mM9qQU9kj3 Just as people of the same age can vary greatly in appearance and shape, so do collections of stars. New observations from Hubble suggest that chronological age alone does not tell the complete story when it comes to the evolution of star clusters: https://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1915/ pic.twitter.com/6IH3iTG7mQ #HubbleFriday From about 15 million light-years away, Hubble has resolved striking details in this star-forming dwarf galaxy, called UGC 685. Dwarf galaxies are smaller and contain many fewer stars than a galaxy like our Milky Way: https://go.nasa.gov/2ZEIqcv pic.twitter.com/0LpJqUeIBw Thank you to Josh Peck (@ItsJoshPeck) for being #curious and touring Hubble's Space Telescope Operations Control Center today @NASAGoddard !pic.twitter.com/M4Dxxt3rsv #HubbleClassic #OTD in 2001, a global dust storm was raging on Mars. These Hubble images show Mars on June 26, 2001, before the storm began (left), and on September 4, 2001, in the midst of the storm (right): https://go.nasa.gov/2NQoQDc pic.twitter.com/1XxX2CUpyf #HubbleFriday Planetary nebula NGC 5307 gives us a glimpse into the future of our own solar system. A dying Sun-like star has run out of nuclear fuel, collapsed in on itself, and shed its outer layers of gas into space: https://go.nasa.gov/2MJJKnK pic.twitter.com/BXZPcUbeeu The event (horizon) is approaching! Mark your calendars for Black Hole Week – September 23-27. pic.twitter.com/RV8nE4gYXk #HubbleClassic This striking nebula glows in the light of a dying star. The colorful, dusty structures are the outer layers of the star that it shed as it began to run out of nuclear fuel. Called NGC 2818, the nebula lies more than 10,000 light-years away: https://go.nasa.gov/2HtlQbH pic.twitter.com/j5yO3gr7NL Students are heading #BackToSchool and beginning to think about their future careers! Check out Hubble's brand new career website and meet some of the folks who make the Hubble team: http://www.nasa.gov/hubblecareers https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRJpOvogZLk … To celebrate @NASAspitzer's 16th birthday, the Hubble team decided to put together a special present for their fellow "observing buddy." #Spitzer16 pic.twitter.com/IKsMKPgxnZ #HubbleFriday Patches of this scene glow brightly as the remnant star emits energetic radiation that excites the gas within these regions, causing it to light up NGC2371/2 will continue to change over the next few thousand years: https://go.nasa.gov/2P9KbK3 pic.twitter.com/UywImN0Xh1 #HubbleClassic Thousands of sparkling young stars are nestled within the giant nebula NGC 3603. About 20,000 light-years away, this stellar "jewel box" is one of the most massive young star clusters in the Milky Way Galaxy: https://go.nasa.gov/2P53Tq6 pic.twitter.com/SJXez0BLQl #HubbleFriday Although it looks more like an entity seen through a microscope than a telescope, this rounded object, named NGC 2022, is certainly not algae or tiny, blobby jellyfish Instead, it's an orb of gas, cast off by an aging star: https://go.nasa.gov/2z4lmEA pic.twitter.com/2qebSitOU3 Today in 2007, @NASAHubble captured this rare edge-on view of the ring system of Uranus. With the planet's 84-year orbit, these rings are only visible to astronomers observing from Earth every 42 years and were not known to exist in 1965. #IdeasThatDefypic.twitter.com/oBkuj4LUUS Happy #LeftHandersDay! Hubble astronaut John Grunsfeld is left handed, which made him especially good at getting to 36 hard-to-reach connectors on the left side of Hubble’s power control unit when it was replaced in 2002. Hear more about it: https://youtu.be/5B1ZBwglIuI #HubbleClassicpic.twitter.com/VLDErtmHtk Happy #BookLoversDay! Do you know about our Hubble Focus e-book series?

The galaxies are interacting, meaning that their mutual gravitational attraction is pulling them closer and closer together and distorting their shapes in the process: https://go.nasa.gov/2yN6OZF pic.twitter.com/F0wIENfjRf #Jupiter is the king of the solar system, more massive than all other solar-system planets combined. Although astronomers have been observing the gas-giant planet for hundreds of years, it still remains a mysterious world: https://go.nasa.gov/2yIQDwB pic.twitter.com/6J2DCzykQZ @NASAHubble hasn't Tweeted yet.

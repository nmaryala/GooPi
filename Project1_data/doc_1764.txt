Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on-demand. Does YouTube TV have ads? Yes, many of the TV networks we offer have ads. When YouTube videos are shown on YouTube TV, the majority of the ad revenue from them will support the creators of those videos. Can I fast-forward through ads? Live TV: Like with traditional TV, you can't fast forward through ads while watching live TV. However, if you pause a show, you can fast forward until you catch up to the live version of the program. DVR: You can record a program by adding it to your Library. This means that all airings- including upcoming airings and reruns- will be recorded automatically. You can typically fast forward through ads on recorded programs once they've aired on live TV. Video on demand: Many networks provide recent episodes of shows, movies, and more on demand. If you've recorded a program that's available on demand at the time you're watching, in some cases the on demand version will be played back instead of your recording. You typically cannot fast-forward through video on demand ads. YouTube videos: If you're a YouTube Premium member, (previously YouTube Red), you won't see ads on any YouTube videos in YouTube TV. If you’re not a YouTube Premium member, you will see ads on YouTube videos, which allows us to support the creators of those videos. What's the difference between YouTube TV and YouTube Premium? YouTube TV is a live TV streaming service with major broadcast and popular cable networks. YouTube Premium, previously YouTube Red, gives you YouTube and YouTube Music ad-free, offline, and in the background. Both memberships give you access to YouTube Originals, but YouTube Premium isn’t included in your YouTube TV membership. However, if you are a YouTube Premium member, you can watch the YouTube content on YouTube TV without ads. More questions? Contact us or visit the YouTube TV Help Center.

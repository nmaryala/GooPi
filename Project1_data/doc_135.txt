Jump to navigation Ever found relief from a hot summer day in the shade of a big tree? Trees provide a lot of benefits, such as shade, cleaning the air, and making our towns and cities nice places to live. Arborists plant, prune, and fertilize trees to keep them healthy. When trees die or become unsafe, arborists remove them. There are lots of career opportunities for arborists since more and more people live in towns and cities. To become a qualified arborist, you need the right education and training; you need the Arboriculture program at the Stockbridge School of Agriculture! Established in 1893, the Arboriculture program at the Stockbridge School of Agriculture is the oldest arboriculture program in the country. Many leaders in the tree care industry have been educated here. The Stockbridge School carries on a proud tradition by offering a two-year education designed to prepare you for a career in arboriculture. Classes are based on the latest arboricultural research and include many outdoor labs to give you the necessary hands-on skills to succeed. If you like working outdoors, improving the environment, using your head and your hands, a career in arboriculture is for you. Americans annually spend $13 billion on tree care, and this amount continues to increase. Homeowners, business owners, and public officials know how important it is to hire qualified arborists to care for trees and shrubs. Arboriculture has many career opportunities. All of our graduates have multiple offers working for tree care companies and as municipal or utility arborists.  The Arboriculture program at the Stockbridge School of Agriculture has a great return on investment. Many of our graduates start their own, successful tree care companies.

M Retweeted Diane Doniol-Valcroze Eeeeeeeeee https://twitter.com/ddoniolvalcroze/status/1170497268778012672 … M added, J.R. Holmsted Retweeted Suso College friend was all laughs playing beer pong & dancing to stupid music with us minutes before he took his life. He went right outside the house & ended it while we were all still hanging out. It was shocking & heartbreaking. It isn’t always obvious. #SuicideAwarenesshttps://twitter.com/sussooo/status/1169390413603643392 … J.R. Holmsted added, If someone gives a fuck about you, let them, dumbass. I really hope to find someone and have a family of my own. That may or may not happen. That said, I try to never stop appreciating what I do have. I love what these two bring into my life. I’m so blessed to call them mine :) #Gratitude #frenchbulldogs #dogsoftwitter #twiceasnicepic.twitter.com/i1KEzofM2g There are just too many assholes in this world. The older I get, the more & more I encounter... It’s not cool to blatantly & shamelessly in a very unsubtle manner cut someone in line. So fucking uncool. My heart breaks whenever I see someone just trying to understand abusive behavior. Desperately searching for a reason, for something that makes sense, and often they’re lost because they can’t understand how deeply abusers value winning and hate losing. Next week will be Friday the 13th AND a full moon. What could possibly go wrong? @whistler2018 hasn't Tweeted yet. Back to top ? Twitter may be over capacity or experiencing a momentary hiccup.
